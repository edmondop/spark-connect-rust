# Spark Connect Rust

A very WIP support for Spark Connect in Rust

## Running tests locally
spark-connect-rust uses `Cargo make` to automate tasks such as starting Spark in the background or cleaning it. Please refer to `cargo make` documentation to install it globally on your environment. Once you have it installed, you can start the Spark instance with `cargo make setup`
